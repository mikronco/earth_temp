# AI for Climate Change 

ML models can play an important role in tackling several problems connected with the effects of climate change. This reporisory contains some simple examples and applications of ML to toy datasets in the fields of weather hazards, forecasting, land monitoring and temperature projections. It can be used as an introductory and self-sufficient course on the most popular techniques for data analysis and statistical learning, ranging from linear regression to convolutional neural networks, with a focus on weather and climate data.
